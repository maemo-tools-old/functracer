Functracer installation instructions
=====================================

1. Compiling from sources
-------------------------

1.1 Dependencies
----------------

For x86, libunwind has to be compiled and installed prior to Functracer. To
compile and install libunwind, issue:

# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libunwind && make && make install

Add libunwind to the dynamic linker's links and cache:

# echo "/usr/local/libunwind/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# ldconfig

For ARM, GDB (version 6.6) has to be compiled prior to Functracer. The
following packages must be installed inside Scratchbox environment:

libreadline4-dev, libexpat1-dev, libc6-dev and binutils-dev

Inside Scratchbox:
[sbox-ARMEL] > apt-get install libreadline4-dev libexpat1-dev libc6-dev binutils-dev

To compile GDB, just type:
[sbox-ARMEL] > ./configure && make


1.2 Compiling Functracer
--------------------------

On x86, to compile and install Functracer, issue:

./configure --with-libunwind=<PATH_TO_LIBUNWIND>
make

On ARM, to compile and install Functracer, issue:

./configure --with-gdb=<PATH_TO_GDB>
make
