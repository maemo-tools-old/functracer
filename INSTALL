functracer installation instructions
====================================

0. Supported platforms
----------------------

Functracer supports tracing of 32-bit ARM and x86 binaries only
(not e.g. 64-bit x86).  There's also partial ARM Thumb support.

Support is mainly about being able to emulate instructions left
under function entry point breakpoints from a different address.
Code assumes 32-bit pointer/instruction sizes.


1. Compiling from sources
-------------------------

1.1 Dependencies
----------------

The following packages must be installed before compiling functracer:
  autoconf(>=2.67), automake(>=1.11), libtool(>=2.2.6), pkg-config(>=0.25),
  binutils-dev(>=2.20.1), help2man(>=1.38.2), libunwind7-dev(>=0.99),
  libsp-rtrace-dev(>=1.6)
  
Note that earlier versions might also work.

On RPM based systems, corresponding packages are most likely named as:
  autoconf, automake, pkg-config, libtool, help2man, binutils-devel,
  libunwind-devel, libsp-rtrace-devel


1.2 Compilation & Installation
------------------------------

To compile functracer extract the source archive and do the following
steps in the functracer directory:

  1) Greate configuration file with "autoreconf -fi"
  2) Create makefile with "./configure"
     The configure tool accepts standard parameters (like installation 
     directory etc.). Try "./configure --help to see all options. There
     are one functracer specific optional parameter:
     --enable-debug  - enables additional debug output in console.
  3) Build the functracer binaries with "make"
     3.1) Optional: run the test suite with "make check" [1]
  4) Install the bult binaries with "make install"

[1] Test-suite has its own requirements.  See testsuite/README
    for more information.  To run all the tests, including gthreads
    one, you need to configure Functracer with Glib v2 headers
    and pkg-config files present.


1.3 Troubleshooting
-------------------

The -d functracer option works only if functracer has been compiled with
--enable-debug option (see Compilation & Installation).

Similarly to Gdb, Functracer needs to use private/interval binutils
API on ARM, so that's most likely to break.  Versions 2.20.1 and 2.22
have been known to work.
