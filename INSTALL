Functracker installation instructions
=====================================

1. Compiling from sources
-------------------------

1.1 Dependencies
----------------

For x86, libunwind has to be compiled and installed prior to Functracker. 
To compile and install libunwind, issue:

# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libunwind && make && make install

Add libunwind to the dynamic linker's links and cache:

# echo "/usr/local/libunwind/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# ldconfig


For ARM, GDB (V6.6) has to be compiled prior to Functracker. The packages
libreadline4-dev, libexpat1-dev, libc6-dev and binutils-dev must be 
installed on scratchbox environment.

Inside scratchbox:
[sbox-ARMEL] > apt-get install libreadline4-dev libexpat1-dev libc6-dev binutils-dev

To GDB, just type:
[sbox-ARMEL] > ./configure && make
