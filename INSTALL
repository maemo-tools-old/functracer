functracer installation instructions
====================================

0. Supported platforms
----------------------

Functracer supports tracing of 32-bit ARM and x86 binaries only.

(Support is mainly about being able to run instructions left under
function entry point breakpoints from a different address.)

Currently it doesn't support e.g. ARM Thumb instructions, enabled
by default on Ubuntu (but not on Debian?), or 64-bit x86.


1. Compiling from sources
-------------------------

1.1 Dependencies
----------------

The following packages must be installed before compiling functracer:
  autoconf(>=2.67), automake(>=1.11), libtool(>=2.2.6), pkg-config(>=0.25),
  binutils-dev(>=2.20.1), help2man(>=1.38.2), libunwind7-dev(>=0.99),
  libsp-rtrace-dev(>=1.6)
  
Note that earlier versions might also work.

On RPM based systems, corresponding packages are most likely named as:
  autoconf, automake, pkg-config, libtool, help2man, binutils-devel,
  libunwind-devel, libsp-rtrace-devel


1.2 Compilation & Installation
------------------------------

To compile functracer extract the source archive and do the following
steps in the functracer directory:

  1) Greate configuration file with "autoreconf -fi"
  2) Create makefile with "./configure"
     The configure tool accepts standard parameters (like installation 
     directory etc.). Try "./configure --help to see all options. There
     are one functracer specific optional parameter:
     --enable-debug  - enables additional debug output in console.
  3) Build the functracer binaries with "make"
  4) Install the bult binaries with "make install"
  

1.3 Troubleshooting
-------------------

The -d functracer option works only if functracer has been compiled with
--enable-debug option (see Compilation & Installation).
