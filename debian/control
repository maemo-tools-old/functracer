Description: Functracer: An Allocation Backtrace Tool
 Functracer is a debugging tool. It gets backtraces of all allocations done in
 ARM/x86 processes. It works with optimized (-O2) code, where debugging symbols
 are available either in the application  binaries themselves, or in separate
 debug files.
